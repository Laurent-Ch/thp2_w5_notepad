Fourth day of learning React. 
Aim of this day project: create a viable notepad storing entries via localStorage.
The user can:
- Create an new entry.
- Erase all content at any given moment via the "new note" button.
- Save their notes. 
- Access all saved notes through the vertical navbar.
- Edit any note as long as the title isn't changed. If it is, saving it will cause a new entry to be created instead. It's not that much of an issue since: 
- Any note can be erased thanks to the dedicated little cross button. 

Slightly annoying detail: the title is being displayed on the navbar with its raw markdown syntax. No light mode, happy eyes galore. Minimalist vibe (codeword for "just enough CSS"). In the end, its simplicity makes it surprisingly functional and agreeable.
